NAME
    RDF::iCalendar - convert between RDF and iCalendar

DESCRIPTION
    This module doesn't do anything itself; it just loads
    RDF::iCalendar::Exporter for you.

  RDF::iCalendar::Exporter
    RDF::iCalendar::Exporter takes some RDF using the W3C's iCalendar
    vocabulary, and outputs RDF::iCalendar::Entity objects.

  RDF::iCalendar::Importer
    RDF::vCard::Importer will do the reverse, but doesn't exist yet.

  RDF::iCalendar::Entity
    An RDF::iCalendar::Entity objects is an individual iCalendar calendar.
    It overloads stringification, so just treat it like a string.

  RDF::iCalendar::Line
    RDF::iCalendar::Line is internal fu that you probably don't want to
    touch.
